My attempt to learn the Rust programming language by writing
a pomodoro bot for Telegram with [tbot.rs](https:://tbot.rs)

## Install

- Message @BotFather on Telegram to acquire a new bot token
- Clone the repo
- Run `cargo install --path .` (I have not pushed it to crates.io yet)
- `export` the token as `BOT_TOKEN` environment variable
- run the bot and have fun being productive ^-^

## Usage

- Message your bot and type `/help` to get usage information
